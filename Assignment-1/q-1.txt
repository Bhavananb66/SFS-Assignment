Q1. Understanding Semantic HTML5 Tags 
a) Define semantic HTML. Why is it important for web accessibility and SEO?
   A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
   
   By providing assistive technologies (like screen readers) with better context about page structure and content, helping users with disabilities navigate more effectively.
   Search engines use semantic elements to better understand the page's structure and content hierarchy, which can improve indexing and search rankings.

b) List five semantic HTML5 elements and explain their purpose.

1. <header> - Represents the introductory content of a document or section. It often contains headings, logos, navigation links, or other opening elements.
2. <nav> - It typically contains links to other pages or parts of the same page.
3. <main>- Represents the main content of the document that is unique and central to the purpose of the page. There should only be one <main> element per page.
4. <article>- Defines a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed or reused independently (like a blog post, news story, or forum post).
5. <footer> - Represents the footer of a section or document. It often includes metadata like author information, related documents, or copyright notices.
