Q5: CSS Units 

a) Explain the differences between px, em, rem, %, vw, and vh.

 *The px unit stands for pixels and represents a fixed size, which doesn’t scale with the user’s settings, making it less responsive.
 *The em unit is relative to the font size of the element’s parent, allowing it to scale based on context.
 *rem stands for “root em” and is relative to the font size of the root element (<html>), providing consistent scaling across the page.
 *The % unit is relative to the size of the parent element and is often used for widths and heights in layout design. 
 *Viewport-based units like vw (viewport width) and vh (viewport height) are relative to the browser’s visible area, making them ideal for responsive layouts that adapt to screen size.
b) When would you prefer to use em or rem over px?
  Use em or rem:
     For scalable, accessible layouts.
     To respect user font-size settings (good for accessibility).
     When building responsive designs that adjust gracefully across devices.

  rem is more predictable than em because it's always relative to the root font size.

c) Write a responsive heading that uses rem units and adapts well to font scaling.
