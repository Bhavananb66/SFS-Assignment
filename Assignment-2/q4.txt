Q4: Box Model and Display

a) Explain the CSS box model with a diagram.
 =>  Content: The actual text or image.
   Padding: Space inside the border, around the content.
   Border: A line surrounding the padding and content.
   Margin: Space outside the border, creating distance between elements.

b) Differentiate between display: block, inline, inline-block, and none with HTML examples.
  1)display: block
    Takes full width by default.
    Starts on a new line.
    You can set width and height.
  ex: <div style="display: block; background: lightblue;">Block Element</div>

  2. display: inline
    Takes only as much width as needed.
    Does not start on a new line.
    Cannot set width or height.
    ex: <span style="display: inline; background: lightgreen;">Inline Element</span>

 3. display: inline-block
    Flows inline, like inline.
    Can set width and height, like block.
    Does not start on a new line.
    ex:<span style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; height: 30px; background: lightcoral;">Inline-Block</span>

4. display: none
   Element is not visible and removed from layout (no space reserved).
   ex:<p style="display: none;"> This will not be displayed.</p>
  
c) Write a CSS rule to convert an inline element into a block-level box
=> span {
  display: block;
}
