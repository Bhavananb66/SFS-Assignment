Q3: Cascade, Specificity, and Inheritance

a) Define cascade, specificity, and inheritance in CSS.
 => * Cascade
   The cascade is the process by which the browser determines which CSS rule applies when multiple rules target the same element. It considers:
   Importance (!important)
   Specificity
   Source order (the last rule wins if specificity is equal)

   *Specificity is a weight assigned to a selector to determine how strongly it applies to an element. Higher specificity wins over lower ones.

   *Inheritance means some CSS properties (like color, font-family) are passed from a parent element to its children unless overridden. Not all properties are inherited.

b) Given the following CSS rules, identify which one will be applied and explain why:
#box { color: red; }
.highlight { color: green; }
div { color: blue; }
<div id="box" class="highlight">Hello</div>

=> color: red will be applied because #box has higher specificity than .highlight and div
