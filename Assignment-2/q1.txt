Q1: CSS Syntax and Types

a) Write the general syntax of a CSS rule.
  selector {
    property: value;
}

b) Explain the differences between inline, internal, and external CSS with suitable examples.
   => *Inline CSS is written directly in the HTML element using the style attribute and is suitable for quick, one-off styling.
      ex: <p style="color: red;">This is inline CSS.</p>

      *Internal CSS is placed within a <style> tag in the <head> section and styles the entire page but is limited to that single file.
      ex: <head>
          <style> p {color: green;} </style>
          </head> 
          <body>
          <p>This is internal CSS.</p>
          </body> 

      *External CSS uses a separate .css file linked via the <link> tag, making it ideal for large projects due to better reusability, maintainability, and separation of content and style.
      ex:  <head>
           <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
           </head>
           <body><p>This is external CSS.</p></body>

           style.css
           p {  color: blue;}
   
        
c) Which method is recommended for large-scale projects and why?

=>External CSS is highly recommended for large-scale projects because:

Separation of concerns: Keeps structure (HTML) and design (CSS) separate

Reusability: One CSS file can style multiple pages

Maintainability: Easier to update or fix styles globally

Performance: CSS files are cached by browsers, improving load speed
